This mobile app is a social media app focused on sharing playlists. Users can create, edit, share, like, and comment on posts. Users attach a playlist to posts that can be played on Spotify.There are also user profiles, email verified accounts, and a direct messaging system. There was additionally a companion website meant to advertise and provide a download for the mobile app. This was made in my junior year at UCF with a team of seven members.
