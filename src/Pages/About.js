                    <p>
                        I am a software developer interested in full-stack development. I have been programming since high school when I created a flash game with my friends. I have always enjoyed
                        programming, and I am especially excited by new and unique problems. I graduated from the University of Central Florida in 2023
                        with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science, set to graduate in late 2025.

                        My work in software has mostly revolved around JavaScript, Python and PostgreSQL. I also have experience in C++, C#, and MySQL. I am comfortable 
                        with MERN and MEAN stacks.
                    </p>

                        In addition to programming knowledge, I took a two-year college program during high school, the Multimedia Design program, that taught me how to use 
                        various Adobe software such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere, and InDesign. I learned Graphic Design fundamentals which I consistently use in
                        front end development today.
